abstract: Tokenization—the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet
  into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary—is a critical yet under-theorized step
  in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated
  into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical
  gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating
  and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose
  a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenization models. This framework
  allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular,
  we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenization
  model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss
  statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation
  of tokenization models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent
  a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.
