abstract: "Homophony's widespread presence in natural languages is a controversial\
  \ topic. Recent theories of language optimality have tried to justify its prevalence,\
  \ despite its negative effects on cognitive processing time; e.g., Piantadosi et\
  \ al. (2012) argued homophony enables the reuse of efficient wordforms and is thus\
  \ beneficial for languages. This hypothesis has recently been challenged by Trott\
  \ and Bergen (2020), who posit that good wordforms are more often homophonous simply\
  \ because they are more phonotactically probable. In this paper, we join in on the\
  \ debate. We first propose a new information-theoretic quantification of a language's\
  \ homophony: the sample Rényi entropy. Then, we use this quantification to revisit\
  \ Trott and Bergen's claims. While their point is theoretically sound, a specific\
  \ methodological issue in their experiments raises doubts about their results. After\
  \ addressing this issue, we find no clear pressure either towards or against homophony\
  \ -- a much more nuanced result than either Piantadosi et al.'s or Trott and Bergen's\
  \ findings."
