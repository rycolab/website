abstract: 'Canonical morphological segmentation aims to divide words into a sequence
  of standardized segments. In this work, we propose a character-based neural encoderdecoder
  model for this task. Additionally, we extend our model to include morphemelevel
  and lexical information through a neural reranker. We set the new state of the art
  for the task improving previous results by up to 21% accuracy. Our experiments cover
  three languages: English, German and Indonesian.'
