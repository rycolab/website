abstract: Current legal outcome prediction models - a staple of legal NLP - do not
  explain their reasoning. However, to employ these models in the real world, human
  legal actors need to be able to understand the model's decisions. In the case of
  common law, legal practitioners reason towards the outcome of a case by referring
  to past case law, known as precedent. We contend that precedent is, therefore, a
  natural way of facilitating explainability for legal NLP models. In this paper,
  we contribute a novel method for identifying the precedent employed by legal outcome
  prediction models. Furthermore, by developing a taxonomy of legal precedent, we
  are able to compare human judges and neural models with respect to the different
  types of precedent they rely on. We find that while the models learn to predict
  outcomes reasonably well, their use of precedent is unlike that of human judges.
