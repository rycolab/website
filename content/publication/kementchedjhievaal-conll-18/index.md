abstract: Most recent approaches to bilingual dictionary induction find a linear alignment
  between the word vector spaces of two languages. We show that projecting the two
  languages onto a third, latent space, rather than directly onto each other, while
  equivalent in terms of expressivity, makes it easier to learn approximate alignments.
  Our modified approach also allows for supporting languages to be included in the
  alignment process, to obtain an even better performance in low resource settings.
