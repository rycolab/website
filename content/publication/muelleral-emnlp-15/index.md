abstract: We present Lemming, a modular log-linear model that jointly models lemmatization
  and tagging and supports the integration of arbitrary global features. It is trainable
  on corpora annotated with gold standard tags and lemmata and does not rely on morphological
  dictionaries or analyzers. Lemming sets the new state of the art in token-based
  statistical lemmatization on six languages; e.g., for Czech lemmatization, we reduce
  the error by 60%, from 4.05 to 1.58. We also give empirical evidence that jointly
  modeling morphological tags and lemmata is mutually beneficial.
