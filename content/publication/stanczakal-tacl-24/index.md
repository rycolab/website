abstract: How much meaning influences gender assignment across languages is an active
  area of research in modern linguistics and cognitive science. We can view current
  approaches as aiming to determine where gender assignment falls on a spectrum, from
  being fully arbitrarily determined to being largely semantically determined. For
  the latter case, there is a formulation of the neo-Whorfian hypothesis, which claims
  that even inanimate noun gender influences how people conceive of and talk about
  objects (using the choice of adjective used to modify inanimate nouns as a proxy
  for meaning). We offer a novel, causal graphical model that jointly represents the
  interactions between a noun's grammatical gender, its meaning, and adjective choice.
  In accordance with past results, we find a significant relationship between the
  gender of nouns and the adjectives which modify them. However, when we control for
  the meaning of the noun, the relationship between grammatical gender and adjective
  choice is near zero and insignificant.
