abstract: The mapping of lexical meanings to wordforms is a major feature of natural
  languages. While usage pressures might assign short words to frequent meanings (Zipf's
  law of abbreviation), the need for a productive and open-ended vocabulary, local
  constraints on sequences of symbols, and various other factors all shape the lexicons
  of the world's languages. Despite their importance in shaping lexical structure,
  the relative contributions of these factors have not been fully quantified. Taking
  a coding-theoretic view of the lexicon and making use of a novel generative statistical
  model, we define upper bounds for the compressibility of the lexicon under various
  constraints. Examining corpora from 7 typologically diverse languages, we use those
  upper bounds to quantify the lexicon's optimality and to explore the relative costs
  of major constraints on natural codes. We find that (compositional) morphology and
  graphotactics can sufficiently account for most of the complexity of natural codes
  -- as measured by code length.
