abstract: Standard automatic metrics, e.g. BLEU, are not reliable for document-level
  MT evaluation. They can neither distinguish document-level improvements in translation
  quality from sentence-level ones, nor identify the discourse phenomena that cause
  context-agnostic translations. This paper introduces a novel automatic metric BlonDe
  to widen the scope of automatic MT evaluation from sentence to document level. BlonDe
  takes discourse coherence into consideration by categorizing discourse-related spans
  and calculating the similarity-based F1 measure of categorized spans. We conduct
  extensive comparisons on a newly constructed dataset BWB. The experimental results
  show that BlonDe possesses better selectivity and interpretability at the document-level,
  and is more sensitive to document-level nuances. In a large-scale human study, BlonDe
  also achieves significantly higher Pearsonâ€™s r correlation with human judgments
  compared to previous metrics.
