abstract: 'The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort providing
  broad-coverage instantiated normalized morphological paradigms for hundreds of diverse
  world languages. The project comprises two major thrusts: a language-independent
  feature schema for rich morphological annotation and a type-level resource of annotated
  data in diverse languages realizing that schema. We have implemented several improvements
  to the extraction pipeline which creates most of our data, so that it is both more
  complete and more correct. We have added 66 new languages, as well as new parts
  of speech for 12 languages. We have also amended the schema in several ways. Finally,
  we present three new community tools: two to validate data for resource creators,
  and one to make morphological data available from the command line. UniMorph is
  based at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University
  in Baltimore, Maryland. This paper details advances made to the schema, tooling,
  and dissemination of project resources since the UniMorph 2.0 release described
  at LREC 2018.'
