abstract: A traditional claim in linguistics is that all human languages are equally
  expressive---able to convey the same wide range of meanings. Morphologically rich
  languages, such as Czech, rely on overt inflectional and derivational morphology
  to convey many semantic distinctions. Languages with comparatively limited morphology,
  such as English, should be able to accomplish the same using a combination of syntactic
  and contextual cues. We capitalize on this idea by training a tagger for English
  that uses syntactic features obtained by automatic parsing to recover complex morphological
  tags projected from Czech. The high accuracy of the resulting model provides quantitative
  confirmation of the underlying linguistic hypothesis of equal expressivity, and
  bodes well for future improvements in downstream HLT tasks including machine translation.
