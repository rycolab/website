abstract: This study describes the structure and the results of the SIGTYP 2022 shared
  task on the prediction of cognate reflexes from multilingual wordlists. We asked
  participants to submit systems that would predict words in individual languages
  with the help of cognate words from related languages. Training and surprise data
  were based on standardized multilingual wordlists from several language families.
  Four teams submitted a total of eight systems, including both neural and non-neural
  systems, as well as systems adjusted to the task and systems using more general
  settings. While all systems showed a rather promising performance, reflecting the
  overwhelming regularity of sound change, the best performance throughout was achieved
  by a system based on convolutional networks originally designed for image restoration.
