abstract: "This year's iteration of the SIGMORPHON Shared Task on morphological reinflection\
  \ focuses on typological diversity and cross-lingual variation of morphosyntactic\
  \ features. In terms of the task, we enrich UniMorph with new data for 32 languages\
  \ from 13 language families, with most of them being under-resourced: Kunwinjku,\
  \ Classical Syriac, Arabic (Modern Standard, Egyptian, Gulf), Hebrew, Amharic, Aymara,\
  \ Magahi, Braj, Kurdish (Central, Northern, Southern), Polish, Karelian, Livvi,\
  \ Ludic, Veps, Võro, Evenki, Xibe, Tuvan, Sakha, Turkish, Indonesian, Kodi, Seneca,\
  \ Asháninka, Yanesha, Chukchi, Itelmen, Eibela. We evaluate six systems on the new\
  \ data and conduct an extensive error analysis of the systems' predictions. Transformer-based\
  \ models generally demonstrate superior performance on the majority of languages,\
  \ achieving >90% accuracy on 65% of them. The languages on which systems yielded\
  \ low accuracy are mainly under-resourced, with a limited amount of data. Most errors\
  \ made by the systems are due to allomorphy, honorificity, and form variation. In\
  \ addition, we observe that systems especially struggle to inflect multiword lemmas.\
  \ The systems also produce misspelled forms or end up in repetitive loops (e.g.,\
  \ RNN-based models). Finally, we report a large drop in systems' performance on\
  \ previously unseen lemmas."
