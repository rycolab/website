abstract: We present a novel cross-lingual transfer method for paradigm completion,
  the task of mapping a lemma to its inflected forms, using a neural encoder-decoder
  model, the state of the art for the monolingual task. We use labeled data from a
  high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In experiments
  on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we obtain up to 58%
  higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even zero-shot and one-shot
  learning are possible. We further find that the degree of language relatedness strongly
  influences the ability to transfer morphological knowledge.
