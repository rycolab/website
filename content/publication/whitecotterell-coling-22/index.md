abstract: "The ability to generalize compositionally is key to understanding the potentially\
  \ infinite number of sentences that can be constructed in a human language from\
  \ only a finite number of words. Investigating whether NLP models possess this ability\
  \ has been a topic of interest: SCAN (Lake and Baroni, 2018) is one task specifically\
  \ proposed to test for this property. Previous work has achieved impressive empirical\
  \ results using a group-equivariant neural network that naturally encodes a useful\
  \ inductive bias for SCAN (Gordon et al., 2020). Inspired by this, we introduce\
  \ a novel group-equivariant architecture that incorporates a group-invariant hard\
  \ alignment mechanism. We find that our network's structure allows it to develop\
  \ stronger equivariance properties than existing group-equivariant approaches. We\
  \ additionally find that it outperforms previous group-equivariant networks empirically\
  \ on the SCAN task. Our results suggest that integrating group-equivariance into\
  \ a variety of neural architectures is a potentially fruitful avenue of research,\
  \ and demonstrate the value of careful analysis of the theoretical properties of\
  \ such architectures."
