abstract: Weir has defined a hierarchy of language classes whose second member ($mathcalL_2$)
  is generated by tree-adjoining grammars (TAG), linear indexed grammars (LIG), combinatory
  categorial grammars, and head grammars. The hierarchy is obtained using the mechanism
  of control, and $mathcalL_2$ is obtained using a context-free grammar (CFG) whose
  derivations are controlled by another CFG. We adapt Weir's definition of a controllable
  CFG to give a definition of controllable pushdown automata (PDAs). This yields three
  new characterizations of $mathcalL_2$ as the class of languages generated by PDAs
  controlling PDAs, PDAs controlling CFGs, and CFGs controlling PDAs. We show that
  these four formalisms are not only weakly equivalent but equivalent in a stricter
  sense that we call d-weak equivalence. Furthermore, using an even stricter notion
  of equivalence called d-strong equivalence, we make precise the intuition that a
  CFG controlling a CFG is a TAG, a PDA controlling a PDA is an embedded PDA, and
  a PDA controlling a CFG is a LIG. The fourth member of this family, a CFG controlling
  a PDA, does not correspond to any formalism we know of, so we invent one and call
  it a Pushdown Adjoining Automaton.
