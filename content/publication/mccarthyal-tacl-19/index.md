abstract: The SIGMORPHON 2019 shared task on cross-lingual transfer and contextual
  analysis in morphology examined transfer learning of inflection between 100 language
  pairs, as well as contextual lemmatization and morphosyntactic description in 66
  languages. The first task evolves past years' inflection tasks by examining transfer
  of morphological inflection knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource
  language. This year also presents a new second challenge on lemmatization and morphological
  feature analysis in context. All submissions featured a neural component and built
  on either this year's strong baselines or highly ranked systems from previous years'
  shared tasks. Every participating team improved in accuracy over the baselines for
  the inflection task (though not Levenshtein distance), and every team in the contextual
  analysis task improved on both state-of-the-art neural and non-neural baselines.
