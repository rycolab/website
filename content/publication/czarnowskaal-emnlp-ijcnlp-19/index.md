abstract: Human translators routinely have to translate rare inflections of words--due
  to the Zipfian distribution of words in a language. When translating from Spanish,
  a good translator would have no problem identifying the proper translation of a
  statistically rare inflection such as habláramos. Note the lexeme itself, hablar,
  is relatively common. In this work, we investigate whether state-of-the-art bilingual
  lexicon inducers are capable of learning this kind of generalization. We introduce
  40 morphologically complete dictionaries in 10 languages and evaluate three of the
  best performing models on the task of translation of less frequent morphological
  forms. We demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art models drops considerably
  when evaluated on infrequent morphological inflections and then show that adding
  a simple morphological constraint at training time improves the performance, proving
  that the bilingual lexicon inducers can benefit from better encoding of morphology.
