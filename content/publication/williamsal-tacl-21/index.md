abstract: We use large-scale corpora in six different gendered languages, along with
  tools from NLP and information theory, to test whether there is a relationship between
  the grammatical genders of inanimate nouns and the adjectives used to describe those
  nouns. For all six languages, we find that there is a statistically significant
  relationship. We also find that there are statistically significant relationships
  between the grammatical genders of inanimate nouns and the verbs that take those
  nouns as direct objects, as indirect objects, and as subjects. We defer a deeper
  investigation of these relationships for future work.
