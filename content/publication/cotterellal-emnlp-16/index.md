abstract: Morphological segmentation has traditionally been modeled with non-hierarchical
  models, which yield flat segmentations as output. In many cases, however, proper
  morphological analysis requires hierarchical structure---especially in the case
  of derivational morphology. In this work, we introduce a discriminative joint model
  of morphological segmentation along with the orthographic changes that occur during
  word formation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to approach
  discriminative segmentation with a context-free model. Additionally, we release
  an annotated treebank of 7454 English words with constituency parses, encouraging
  future research in this area.
