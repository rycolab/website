abstract: 'The noun lexica of many natural languages are divided into several declension
  classes with characteristic morphological properties. Class membership is far from
  deterministic, but the phonological form of a noun and/or its meaning can often
  provide imperfect clues. Here, we investigate the strength of those clues. More
  specifically, we operationalize this by measuring how much information, in bits,
  we can glean about declension class from knowing the form and/or meaning of nouns.
  We know that form and meaning are often also indicative of grammatical gender &mdash;
  which, as we quantitatively verify, can itself share information with declension
  class &mdash; so we also control for gender. We find for two Indo-European languages
  (Czech and German) that form and meaning respectively share significant amounts
  of information with class (and contribute additional information above and beyond
  gender). The three-way interaction between class, form, and meaning (given gender)
  is also significant. Our study is important for two reasons: First, we introduce
  a new method that provides additional quantitative support for a classic linguistic
  finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into
  declensions. Secondly, we show not only that individual declensions classes vary
  in the strength of their clues within a language, but also that these variations
  themselves vary across languages. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/rycolab/declension-mi.'
