abstract: Typological knowledge bases (KBs) such as WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013)
  contain information about linguistic properties of the world’s languages. They have
  been shown to be useful for downstream applications, including cross-lingual transfer
  learning and linguistic probing. A major drawback hampering broader adoption of
  typological KBs is that they are sparsely populated, in the sense that most languages
  only have annotations for some features, and skewed, in that few features have wide
  coverage. As typological features often correlate with one another, it is possible
  to predict them and thus automatically populate typological KBs, which is also the
  focus of this shared task. Overall, the task attracted 8 submissions from 5 teams,
  out of which the most successful methods make use of such feature correlations.
  However, our error analysis reveals that even the strongest submitted systems struggle
  with predicting feature values for languages where few features are known.
