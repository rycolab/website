abstract: What makes some types of languages more probable than others? For instance,
  we know that almost all spoken languages contain the vowel phoneme /i/; why should
  that be? The field of linguistic typology seeks to answer these questions and, thereby,
  divine the mechanisms that underlie human language. In our work, we tackle the problem
  of vowel system typology, i.e., we propose a generative probability model of which
  vowels a language contains. In contrast to previous work, we work directly with
  the acoustic information---the first two formant values---rather than modeling discrete
  sets of symbols from the international phonetic alphabet. We develop a novel generative
  probability model and report results on over 200 languages.
