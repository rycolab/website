abstract: Linguistic similarity is multi-faceted. For instance, two words may be similar
  with respect to semantics, syntax, or morphology inter alia. Continuous word-embeddings
  have been shown to capture most of these shades of similarity to some degree. This
  work considers guiding word-embeddings with morphologically annotated data, a form
  of semi-supervised learning, encouraging the vectors to encode a word’s morphology,
  i.e., words close in the embedded space share morphological features. We extend
  the log-bilinear model to this end and show that indeed our learned embeddings achieve
  this, using German as a case study.
