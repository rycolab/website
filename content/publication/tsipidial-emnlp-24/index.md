abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis posits that speakers tend
  to distribute information evenly across linguistic units to achieve efficient communication.
  Of course, information rate in texts and discourses is not perfectly uniform. While
  these fluctuations can be viewed as theoretically uninteresting noise on top of
  a uniform target, another explanation is that UID is not the only functional pressure
  regulating information content in a language. Speakers may also seek to maintain
  interest, adhere to writing conventions, and build compelling arguments. In this
  paper, we propose one such functional pressure; namely that speakers modulate information
  rate based on location within a hierarchically-structured model of discourse. We
  term this the Structured Context Hypothesis and test it by predicting the surprisal
  contours of naturally occurring discourses extracted from large language models
  using predictors derived from discourse structure. We find that hierarchical predictors
  are significant predictors of a discourse's information contour and that deeply
  nested hierarchical predictors are more predictive than shallow ones. This work
  takes an initial step beyond UID to propose testable hypotheses for why the information
  rate fluctuates in predictable ways.
