abstract: String similarity is most often measured by weighted or unweighted edit
  distance d(x, y). Ristad and Yianilos (1998) defined stochastic edit distance—a
  probability distribution p(y | x) whose parameters can be trained from data. We
  generalize this so that the probability of choosing each edit operation can depend
  on contextual features. We show how to construct and train a probabilistic finite-state
  transducer that computes our stochastic  ontextual edit distance. To illustrate
  the improvement from conditioning on context, we model typos found in social media
  text.
