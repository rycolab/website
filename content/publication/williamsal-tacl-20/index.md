abstract: We use large-scale corpora in six different gendered languages, along with
  tools from NLP and information theory, to test whether there is a relationship between
  the grammatical genders of inanimate nouns and the adjectives used to describe those
  nouns. For all six languages, we find that there is a statistically significant
  relationship. We also find that there are statistically significant relation- ships
  between the grammatical genders of inanimate nouns and the verbs that take those
  nouns as direct objects, as indirect objects, and as subjects. We defer a deeper
  investiga- tion of these relationships for future work.
