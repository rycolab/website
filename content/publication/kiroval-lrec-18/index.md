abstract: The Universal Morphology (UniMorph) project is a collaborative effort to
  improve how NLP handles complex morphology across the world’s languages. The project
  releases annotated morphological data using a universal tagset, the UniMorph schema.
  Each inflected form is associated with a lemma, which typically carries its underlying
  lexical meaning, and a bundle of morphological features from our schema. Additional
  supporting data and tools are also released on a per-language basis when available.
  UniMorph is based at the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns
  Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. This paper details advances made to the
  collection, annotation, and dissemination of project resources since the initial
  UniMorph release described at LREC 2016.
