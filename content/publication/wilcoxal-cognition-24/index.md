abstract: 'Regressions, or backward saccades, are common during reading, accounting
  for between 5% and 20% of all saccades. And yet, relatively little is known about
  what causes them. We provide an information-theoretic operationalization for two
  previous qualitative hypotheses about regressions, which we dub reactivation and
  reanalysis. We argue that these hypotheses make different predictions about the
  pointwise mutual information or pmi between a regression’s source and target. Intuitively,
  the pmi between two words measures how much more (or less) likely one word is to
  be present given the other. On one hand, the reactivation hypothesis predicts that
  regressions occur between words that are associated, implying high positive values
  of pmi. On the other hand, the reanalysis hypothesis predicts that regressions should
  occur between words that are not associated with each other, implying negative,
  low values of pmi. As a second theoretical contribution, we expand on previous theories
  by considering not only pmi but also expected values of pmi, E[pmi], where the expectation
  is taken over all possible realizations of the regression’s target. The rationale
  for this is that language processing involves making inferences under uncertainty,
  and readers may be uncertain about what they have read, especially if a previous
  word was skipped. To test both theories, we use contemporary language models to
  estimate pmi-based statistics over word pairs in three corpora of eye tracking data
  in English, as well as in six languages across three language families (Indo-European,
  Uralic, and Turkic). Our results are consistent across languages and models tested:
  Positive values of pmi and E[pmi] consistently help to predict the patterns of regressions
  during reading, whereas negative values of pmi and E[pmi] do not. Our information-theoretic
  interpretation increases the predictive scope of both theories and our studies present
  the first systematic crosslinguistic analysis of regressions in the literature.
  Our results support the reactivation hypothesis and, more broadly, they expand the
  number of language processing behaviors that can be linked to information-theoretic
  principles.'
