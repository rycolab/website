abstract: Significance testing‚Äîespecially the paired-permutation test‚Äîhas played a
  vital role in developing NLP systems to provide confidence that the difference in
  performance between two systems (i.e., the test statistic) is not due to luck. However,
  practitioners rely on Monte Carlo approximation to perform this test due to a lack
  of a suitable exact algorithm. In this paper, we provide an efficient exact algorithm
  for the paired-permutation test for a family of structured test statistics. Our
  algorithm runs in ùí™(G N (log GN )(log N)) time where N is the dataset size and G
  is the range of the test statistic. We found that our exact algorithm was 10x faster
  than the Monte Carlo approximation with 20000 samples on a common dataset
