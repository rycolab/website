abstract: Computational historical linguistics seeks to systematically understand
  processes of sound change, including during periods at which little to no formal
  recording of language is attested. At the same time, few computational resources
  exist which deeply explore phonological and morphological connections between proto-languages
  and their descendants. This is particularly true for the family of Italic languages.
  To assist historical linguists in the study of Italic sound change, we introduce
  the Proto-Italic to Latin (PILA) dataset, which consists of roughly 3,000 pairs
  of forms from Proto-Italic and Latin. We provide a detailed description of how our
  dataset was created and organized. Then, we exhibit PILA’s value in two ways. First,
  we present baseline results for PILA on a pair of traditional computational historical
  linguistics tasks. Second, we demonstrate PILA’s capability for enhancing other
  historical-linguistic datasets through a dataset compatibility study.
