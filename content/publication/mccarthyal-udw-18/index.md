abstract: The Universal Dependencies (UD) and Universal Morphology (UniMorph) projects
  each present schemata for annotating the morphosyntactic details of language. Each
  project also provides corpora of annotated text in many languages---UD at the token
  level and UniMorph at the type level. As each corpus is built by different annotators,
  language-specific decisions hinder the goal of universal schemata. With compatibility
  of tags, each project's annotations could be used to validate the other's. Additionally,
  the availability of both type- and token-level resources would be a boon to tasks
  such as parsing and homograph disambiguation. To ease this interoperability, we
  present a deterministic mapping from Universal Dependencies v2 features into the
  UniMorph schema. We validate our approach by lookup in the UniMorph corpora and
  find a macro-average of 64.13% recall. We also note incompatibilities due to paucity
  of data on either side. Finally, we present a critical evaluation of the foundations,
  strengths, and weaknesses of the two annotation projects.
