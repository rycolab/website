abstract: 'We present a study of morphological irregularity. Following recent work,
  we define an information-theoretic measure of irregularity based on the predictability
  of forms in a language. Using a neural transduction model, we estimate this quantity
  for the forms in 28 languages. We first present several validatory and exploratory
  analyses of irregularity. We then show that our analyses provide evidence for a
  correlation between irregularity and frequency: higher frequency items are more
  likely to be irregular and irregular items are more likely be highly frequent. To
  our knowledge, this result is the first of its breadth and confirms longstanding
  proposals from the linguistics literature. The correlation is more robust when aggregated
  at the level of whole paradigms---providing support for models of linguistic structure
  in which inflected forms are unified by abstract underlying stems or lexemes.'
