abstract: We report the results of our system on the Metaphor Detection Shared Task
  at the Second Workshop on Figurative Language Processing 2020. Our model is an ensemble,
  utilising contextualised and static distributional semantic representations, along
  with word-type concreteness ratings. Using these features, it predicts word metaphoricity
  with a deep multi-layer perceptron. We are able to best the state-of-the-art from
  the 2018 Shared Task by an average of 8.0% F1, and finish fourth in both sub-tasks
  in which we participate.
