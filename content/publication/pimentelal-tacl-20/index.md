abstract: We present methods for calculating a measure of phonotactic complexity—bits
  per phoneme—that permits a straightforward cross-linguistic comparison. When given
  a word, represented as a sequence of phonemic segments such as symbols in the international
  phonetic alphabet, and a statistical model trained on a sample of word types from
  the language, we can approximately measure bits per phoneme using the negative log-probability
  of that word under the model. This simple measure allows us to compare the entropy
  across languages, giving insight into how complex a language’s phonotactics are.
  Using a collection of 1016 basic concept words across 106 languages, we demonstrate
  a very strong negative correlation of −0.74 between bits per phoneme and the average
  length of words.
