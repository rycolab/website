abstract: 'While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and
  word order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic statistical
  patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort to identify these
  pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual word orders. Yet one
  functional pressure has been overlooked in such investigations: the uniform information
  density (UID) hypothesis, which holds that information should be spread evenly throughout
  an utterance. Here, we ask whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order
  patterns cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test
  whether real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders.
  In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i)
  among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than
  reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual orders
  consistently exceed the uniformity of real orders. These findings are compatible
  with a pressure for information uniformity in the development and usage of natural
  languages.'
