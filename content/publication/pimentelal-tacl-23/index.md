abstract: "Over the past two decades, numerous studies have demonstrated how less\
  \ predictable (i.e. higher surprisal) words take more time to read. In general,\
  \ these previous studies implicitly assumed the reading process to be purely responsive:\
  \ readers observe a new word and allocate time to read it as required. These results,\
  \ however, are also compatible with a reading time that is anticipatory: readers\
  \ could, e.g., allocate time to a future word based on their expectation about it.\
  \ In this work, we examine the anticipatory nature of reading by looking at how\
  \ people's predictions about upcoming material influence reading times. Specifically,\
  \ we test anticipation by looking at the effects of surprisal and contextual entropy\
  \ on four reading-time datasets: two self-paced and two eye-tracking. In three of\
  \ four datasets tested, we find that the entropy predicts reading times as well\
  \ as (or better than) the surprisal. We then hypothesise four cognitive mechanisms\
  \ through which the contextual entropy could impact RTs -- three of which we design\
  \ experiments to analyse. Overall, our results support a view of reading that is\
  \ both anticipatory and responsive."
