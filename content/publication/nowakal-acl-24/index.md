abstract: The performance of modern language models (LMs) has been improved by chain-of-thought
  (CoT) reasoning, i.e., the process of generating intermediate results that guide
  the model towards a final answer. A possible explanation for this improvement is
  that CoT reasoning extends an LM's computational power, as RNNs and transformers
  with additional scratch space are known to be Turing complete. Comparing LMs to
  Turing machines, however, introduces a category error - Turing machines decide language
  membership, whereas LMs define distributions over strings. To bridge this gap, we
  formalize CoT reasoning in a probabilistic setting. We present several results on
  the representational capacity of recurrent and transformer LMs with CoT reasoning,
  showing that they can represent the same family of distributions over strings as
  probabilistic Turing machines.
