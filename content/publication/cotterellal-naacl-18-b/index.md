abstract: Lexical ambiguity makes it difficult to compute useful statistics of a corpus.
  A given word form might represent any of several morphological feature bundles.
  One can, however, use unsupervised learning (as in EM) to fit a model that probabilistically
  disambiguates word forms. We present such an approach, which employs a neural network
  to smoothly model a prior distribution over feature bundles (even rare ones). Although
  this basic model does not consider a token's context, that very property allows
  it to operate on a simple list of unigram type counts, partitioning each count among
  different analyses of that unigram. We discuss evaluation metrics for this novel
  task and report results on 5 languages.
