abstract: "While there exist scores of natural languages, each with its unique features\
  \ and idiosyncrasies, they all share a unifying theme: enabling human communication.\
  \ We may thus reasonably predict that human cognition shapes how these languages\
  \ evolve and are used. Assuming that the capacity to process information is roughly\
  \ constant across human populations, we expect a surprisal--duration trade-off to\
  \ arise both across and within languages. We analyse this trade-off using a corpus\
  \ of 600 languages and, after controlling for several potential confounds, we find\
  \ strong supporting evidence in both settings. Specifically, we find that, on average,\
  \ phones are produced faster in languages where they are less surprising, and vice\
  \ versa. Further, we confirm that more surprising phones are longer, on average,\
  \ in 319 languages out of the 600. We thus conclude that there is strong evidence\
  \ of a surprisal--duration trade-off in operation, both across and within the world's\
  \ languages."
