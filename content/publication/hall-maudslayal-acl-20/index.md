abstract: 'Measuring what linguistic information is encoded in continuous representations
  of language has become a popular area of research. To do this, researchers train
  \"probes\"— supervised models designed to extract linguistic structure from embeddings.
  The line between what constitutes a probe and a model designed to achieve a particular
  task is often blurred. To fully understand what we are learning about the target
  language representation—or the instrument with which we performing measurement with
  for that matter—we would do well to compare probes to classic parsers. As a case
  study, we consider the structural probe (Hewitt and Manning, 2019), designed to
  quantify the presence of syntactic information. We create a simple parser that improves
  upon the performance of the structural probe by 11.4% on UUAS, despite having an
  identical lightweight parameterization. Under a second less common metric, however,
  the structural probe outperforms traditional parsers. This begs the question: why
  should some metrics be preferred for probing and others for parsing?'
