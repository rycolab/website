abstract: 'While language identification is a fundamental speech and language processing
  task, for many languages and language families it remains a challenging task. For
  many low-resource and endangered languages this is in part due to resource availability:
  where larger datasets exist, they may be single-speaker or have different domains
  than desired application scenarios, demanding a need for domain and speaker-invariant
  language identification systems. This year’s shared task on robust spoken language
  identification sought to investigate just this scenario: systems were to be trained
  on largely single-speaker speech from one domain, but evaluated on data in other
  domains recorded from speakers under different recording circumstances, mimicking
  realistic low-resource scenarios. We see that domain and speaker mismatch proves
  very challenging for current methods which can perform above 95% accuracy in-domain,
  which domain adaptation can address to some degree, but that these conditions merit
  further investigation to make spoken language identification accessible in many
  scenarios.'
