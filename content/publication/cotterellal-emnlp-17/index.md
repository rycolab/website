abstract: The generation of complex derived word forms has been an overlooked problem
  in NLP; we fill this gap by applying neural sequence-to-sequence models to the task.
  We overview the theoretical motivation for a paradigmatic treatment of derivational
  morphology, and introduce the task of derivational paradigm completion as a parallel
  to inflectional paradigm completion. State-of-the-art neural models adapted from
  the inflection task are able to learn the range of derivation patterns, and outperform
  a non-neural baseline by 16.4%. However, due to semantic, historical, and lexical
  considerations involved in derivational morphology, future work will be needed to
  achieve performance parity with inflection-generating systems.
