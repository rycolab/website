abstract: 'Studying the ways in which language is gendered has long been an area of
  interest in sociolinguistics. Studies have explored, for example, the speech of
  male and female characters in film and the language used to describe male and female
  politicians. In this paper, we aim not to merely study this phenomenon qualitatively,
  but instead to quantify the degree to which the language used to describe men and
  women is different and, moreover, different in a positive or negative way. To that
  end, we introduce a generative latent-variable model that jointly represents adjective
  (or verb) choice, with its sentiment, given the natural gender of a head (or dependent)
  noun. We find that there are significant differences between descriptions of male
  and female nouns and that these differences align with common gender stereotypes:
  Positive adjectives used to describe women are more often related to their bodies
  than adjectives used to describe men.'
