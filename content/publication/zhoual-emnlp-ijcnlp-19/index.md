abstract: Recent studies have shown that word embeddings exhibit gender bias inherited
  from the training corpora. However, most studies to date have focused on quantifying
  and mitigating such bias only in English. These analyses cannot be directly extended
  to languages that exhibit morphological agreement on gender, such as Spanish and
  French. In this paper, we propose new metrics for evaluating gender bias in word
  embeddings of these languages and further demonstrate evidence of gender bias in
  bilingual embeddings which align these languages with English. Finally, we extend
  an existing approach to mitigate gender bias in word embedding of these languages
  under both monolingual and bilingual settings. Experiments on modified Word Embedding
  Association Test, word similarity, word translation, and word pair translation tasks
  show that the proposed approaches can effectively reduce the gender bias while preserving
  the utility of the original embeddings.
