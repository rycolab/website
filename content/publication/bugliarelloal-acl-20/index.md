abstract: 'The performance of neural machine translation systems is commonly evaluated
  in terms of BLEU. However, due to its reliance on target language properties and
  generation, the BLEU metric does not allow an assessment of which translation directions
  are more difficult to model. In this paper, we propose cross-mutual information
  (XMI): an asymmetric information-theoretic metric of machine translation difficulty
  that exploits the probabilistic nature of most neural machine translation models.
  XMI allows us to better evaluate the difficulty of translating text into the target
  language while controlling for the difficulty of the target-side generation component
  independent of the translation task. We then present the first systematic and controlled
  study of cross-lingual translation difficulties using modern neural translation
  systems. Code for replicating our experiments is available online at https://github.com/e-bug/nmt-difficulty.'
