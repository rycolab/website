abstract: "A good automatic evaluation metric for language generation ideally correlates\
  \ highly with human judgements of text quality. Yet, there is a dearth of such metrics,\
  \ which inhibits the rapid and efficient progress of language generators. One exception\
  \ is the recently proposed Mauve. In theory, Mauve measures an information-theoretic\
  \ divergence between two probability distributions over strings: one representing\
  \ the language generator under evaluation; the other representing the true natural\
  \ language distribution. Mauve's authors argue that its success comes from the qualitative\
  \ properties of their proposed divergence. Yet in practice, as this divergence is\
  \ uncomputable, Mauve approximates it by measuring the divergence between multinomial\
  \ distributions over clusters instead, where cluster assignments are attained by\
  \ grouping strings based on a pre-trained language model's embeddings. As we show,\
  \ however, this is not a tight approximation -- in either theory or practice. This\
  \ begs the question: why does Mauve work so well? In this work, we show that Mauve\
  \ was right for the wrong reasons, and that its newly proposed divergence is not\
  \ necessary for its high performance. In fact, classical divergences paired with\
  \ its proposed cluster-based approximation may actually serve as better evaluation\
  \ metrics. We finish the paper with a probing analysis; this analysis leads us to\
  \ conclude that -- by encoding syntactic- and coherence-level features of text,\
  \ while ignoring surface-level features -- such cluster-based substitutes to string\
  \ distributions may simply be better for evaluating state-of-the-art language generators."
