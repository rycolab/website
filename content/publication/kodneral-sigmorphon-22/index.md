abstract: 'The 2022 SIGMORPHON–UniMorph shared task on large scale morphological inflection
  generation included a wide range of typologically diverse languages: 33 languages
  from 11 top-level language families: Arabic (Modern Standard), Assamese, Braj, Chukchi,
  Eastern Armenian, Evenki, Georgian, Gothic, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hungarian, Itelmen,
  Karelian, Kazakh, Ket, Khalkha Mongolian, Kholosi, Korean, Lamahalot, Low German,
  Ludic, Magahi, Middle Low German, Old English, Old High German, Old Norse, Polish,
  Pomak, Slovak, Turkish, Upper Sorbian, Veps, and Xibe. We emphasize generalization
  along different dimensions this year by evaluating test items with unseen lemmas
  and unseen features separately under small and large training conditions. Across
  the five submitted systems and two baselines, the prediction of inflections with
  unseen features proved challenging, with average performance decreased substantially
  from last year. This was true even for languages for which the forms were in principle
  predictable, which suggests that further work is needed in designing systems that
  capture the various types of generalization required for the world’s languages.'
