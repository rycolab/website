abstract: The 2016 SIGMORPHON Shared Task was devoted to the problem of morphological
  reinflection. It introduced morphological datasets for 10 languages with diverse
  typological characteristics. The shared task drew submissions from 9 teams representing
  11 institutions reflecting a variety of approaches to addressing supervised learning
  of reinflection. For the simplest task, inflection generation from lemmas, the best
  system averaged 95.56% exact-match accuracy across all languages, ranging from Maltese
  (88.99%) to Hungarian (99.30%). With the relatively large training datasets provided,
  recurrent neural network architectures consistently performed best—in fact, there
  was a significant margin between neural and non-neural approaches. The best neural
  approach, averaged over all tasks and languages, outperformed the best nonneural
  one by 13.76% absolute; on individual tasks and languages the gap in accuracy sometimes
  exceeded 60%. Overall, the results show a strong state of the art, and serve as
  encouragement for future shared tasks that explore morphological analysis and generation
  with varying degrees of supervision.
