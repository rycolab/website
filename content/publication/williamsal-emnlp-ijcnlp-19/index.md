abstract: Many of the world's languages employ grammatical gender on the lexeme. For
  instance, in Spanish, house ''casa'' is feminine, whereas the word for paper ''papel''
  is masculine. To a speaker of a genderless language, this categorization seems to
  exist with neither rhyme nor reason. But, is the association of nouns to gender
  classes truly arbitrary? In this work, we present the first large-scale investigation
  of the arbitrariness of gender assignment that uses canonical correlation analysis
  as a method for correlating the gender of inanimate nouns with their lexical semantic
  meaning. We find that the gender systems of 18 languages exhibit a significant correlation
  with an externally grounded definition of lexical semantics.
