abstract: "A fundamental result in psycholinguistics is that less predictable words
  take a longer time to process. One theoretical explanation for this finding is Surprisal
  Theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which quantifies a word's predictability as its
  surprisal, i.e. its negative log-probability given a context. While evidence supporting
  the predictions of Surprisal Theory have been replicated widely, most have focused
  on a very narrow slice of data: native English speakers reading English texts. Indeed,
  no comprehensive multilingual analysis exists. We address this gap in the current
  literature by investigating the relationship between surprisal and reading times
  in eleven different languages, distributed across five language families. Deriving
  estimates from language models trained on monolingual and multilingual corpora,
  we test three predictions associated with surprisal theory: (i) whether surprisal
  is predictive of reading times; (ii) whether expected surprisal, i.e. contextual
  entropy, is predictive of reading times; (iii) and whether the linking function
  between surprisal and reading times is linear. We find that all three predictions
  are borne out crosslinguistically. By focusing on a more diverse set of languages,
  we argue that these results offer the most robust link to-date between information
  theory and incremental language processing across languages."
