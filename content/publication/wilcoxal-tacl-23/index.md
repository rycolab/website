abstract: "A fundamental result in psycholinguistics is that less predictable words\
  \ take a longer time to process. One theoretical explanation for this finding is\
  \ Surprisal Theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), which quantifies a word's predictability\
  \ as its surprisal, i.e. its negative log-probability given a context. While evidence\
  \ supporting the predictions of Surprisal Theory have been replicated widely, most\
  \ have focused on a very narrow slice of data: native English speakers reading English\
  \ texts. Indeed, no comprehensive multilingual analysis exists. We address this\
  \ gap in the current literature by investigating the relationship between surprisal\
  \ and reading times in eleven different languages, distributed across five language\
  \ families. Deriving estimates from language models trained on monolingual and multilingual\
  \ corpora, we test three predictions associated with surprisal theory: (i) whether\
  \ surprisal is predictive of reading times; (ii) whether expected surprisal, i.e.\
  \ contextual entropy, is predictive of reading times; (iii) and whether the linking\
  \ function between surprisal and reading times is linear. We find that all three\
  \ predictions are borne out crosslinguistically. By focusing on a more diverse set\
  \ of languages, we argue that these results offer the most robust link to-date between\
  \ information theory and incremental language processing across languages."
