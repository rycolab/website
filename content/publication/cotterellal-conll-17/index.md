abstract: The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task on supervised morphological generation
  required systems to be trained and tested in each of 52 typologically diverse languages.
  In sub-task 1, submitted systems were asked to predict a specific inflected form
  of a given lemma. In sub-task 2, systems were given a lemma and some of its specific
  inflected forms, and asked to complete the inflectional paradigm by predicting all
  of the remaining inflected forms. Both sub-tasks included high, medium, and low-resource
  conditions. Sub-task 1 received 24 system submissions, while sub-task 2 received
  3 system submissions. Following the success of neural sequence-to-sequence models
  in the SIGMORPHON 2016 shared task, all but one of the submissions included a neural
  component. The results show that high performance can be achieved with small training
  datasets, so long as models have appropriate inductive bias or make use of additional
  unlabeled data or synthetic data. However, different biasing and data augmentation
  resulted in non-identical sets of inflected forms being predicted correctly, suggesting
  that there is room for future improvement.
