abstract: Numerous analyses of reading time (RT) data have been undertaken in the
  effort to learn more about the internal processes that occur during reading comprehension.
  However, data measured on words at the end of a sentence–or even clause–is often
  omitted due to the confounding factors introduced by so-called “wrap-up effects,”
  which manifests as a skewed distribution of RTs for these words. Consequently, the
  understanding of the cognitive processes that might be involved in these effects
  is limited. In this work, we attempt to learn more about these processes by looking
  for the existence–or absence–of a link between wrap-up effects and information theoretic
  quantities, such as word and context information content. We find that the information
  distribution of prior context is often predictive of sentence- and clause-final
  RTs (while not of sentence-medial RTs), which lends support to several prior hypotheses
  about the processes involved in wrap-up effects.
