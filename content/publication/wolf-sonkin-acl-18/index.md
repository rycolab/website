abstract: 'Statistical morphological inflectors are typically trained on fully supervised,
  type-level data. One remaining open research question is the following: How can
  we effectively exploit raw, token-level data to improve their performance? To this
  end, we introduce a novel generative latent-variable model for the semi-supervised
  learning of inflection generation. To enable posterior inference over the latent
  variables, we derive an efficient variational inference procedure based on the wake-sleep
  algorithm. We experiment on 23 languages, using the Universal Dependencies corpora
  in a simulated low-resource setting, and find improvements of over 10% absolute
  accuracy in some cases.'
