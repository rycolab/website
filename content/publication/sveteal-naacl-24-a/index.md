abstract: The recent successes and spread of large neural language models (LMs) call
  for a thorough understanding of their abilities. Describing their abilities through
  LMsâ€™ representational capacity is a lively area of research. Investigations of the
  representational capacity of neural LMs have predominantly focused on their ability
  to recognize formal languages. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as
  classifiers are tightly linked to regular languages, i.e., languages defined by
  finite-state automata (FSAs). Such results, however, fall short of describing the
  capabilities of RNN language models (LMs), which are definitionally distributions
  over strings. We take a fresh look at the represen- tational capacity of RNN LMs
  by connecting them to probabilistic FSAs and demonstrate that RNN LMs with linearly
  bounded precision can express arbitrary regular LMs.
