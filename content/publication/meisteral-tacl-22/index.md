abstract: "Today's probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing\
  \ coherent and fluent text, despite the fact that the underlying models perform\
  \ incredibly well in terms of standard metrics such as perplexity.   This dichotomy\
  \ has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this\
  \ work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language generation as a discrete\
  \ stochastic process can provide new insights into the behavior of probabilistic\
  \ language generators, e.g., why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive.\
  \ Humans use language as a means of communicating information, aiming to do so in\
  \ a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing manner; in fact, psycholinguistics\
  \ research suggests humans choose each word in a string with this subconscious goal\
  \ in mind. We formally define the set of strings that meet this criterion: those\
  \ for which each word has an information content close to the emphexpected information\
  \ content, i.e., the conditional entropy of our model. We then propose a simple\
  \ and efficient procedure for enforcing this criterion when generating from probabilistic\
  \ models, which we call locally typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations\
  \ show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, typical sampling offers\
  \ competitive performance (in both abstractive summarization and story generation)\
  \ in terms of quality while consistently reducing degenerate repetitions."
