abstract: Understanding the origins of militarized conflict is a complex, yet important
  undertaking. Existing research seeks to build this understanding by considering
  bi-lateral relationships between entity pairs (dyadic causes) and multi-lateral
  relationships among multiple entities (systemic causes). The aim of this work is
  to compare these two causes in terms of how they correlate with conflict between
  two entities. We do this by devising a set of textual and graph-based features which
  represent each of the causes. The features are extracted from Wikipedia and modeled
  as a large graph. Nodes in this graph represent entities connected by labeled edges
  representing ally or enemy-relationships. This allows casting the problem as an
  edge classification task, which we term dyad classification. We propose and evaluate
  classifiers to determine if a particular pair of entities are allies or enemies.
  Our results suggest that our systemic features might be slightly better correlates
  of conflict. Further, we find that Wikipedia articles of allies are semantically
  more similar than enemies.
