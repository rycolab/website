abstract: We present penalized expectation propagation (PEP), a novel algorithm for
  approximate inference in graphical models. Expectation propagation is a variant
  of loopy belief propagation that keeps messages tractable by projecting them back
  into a given family of functions. Our extension, PEP, uses a structuredsparsity
  penalty to encourage simple messages, thus balancing speed and accuracy. We specifically
  show how to instantiate PEP in the case of string-valued random variables, where
  we adaptively approximate finite-state distributions by variable-order n-gram models.
  On phonological inference problems, we obtain substantial speedup over previous
  related algorithms with no significant loss in accuracy.
