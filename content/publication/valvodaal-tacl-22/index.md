abstract: The introduction of large public legal datasets has brought about a renaissance
  in legal NLP. Many of these datasets are comprised of legal judgements â€“ the product
  of judges deciding cases. This fact, together with the way machine learning works,
  means that several legal NLP models are models of judges. While some have argued
  for the automation of judges, in this position piece, we argue that automating the
  role of the judge raises difficult ethical challenges, in particular for common
  law legal systems. Our argument follows from the social role of the judge in actively
  shaping the law, rather than merely applying it. Since current NLP models come nowhere
  close to having the facilities necessary for this task, they should not be used
  to automate judges. Furthermore, even in the case the models could achieve human-level
  capabilities, there would still be remaining ethical concerns inherent in the automation
  of the legal process.
