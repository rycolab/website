abstract: This work presents an information-theoretic operationalisation of cross-linguistic
  non-arbitrariness. It is not a new idea that there are small, cross-linguistic associations
  between the forms and meanings of words. For instance, it has been claimed (Blasi
  et al., 2016) that the word for \"tongue\" is more likely than chance to contain
  the phone [l]. By controlling for the influence of language family and geographic
  proximity within a very large concept-aligned cross-lingual lexicon, we extend methods
  previously used to detect within language non-arbitrariness (Pimentel et al., 2019)
  to measure cross-linguistic associations. We find that there is a significant effect
  of non-arbitrariness, but it is unsurprisingly small (less than 0.5% on average
  according to our information-theoretic estimate). We also provide a concept-level
  analysis which shows that a quarter of the concepts considered in our work exhibit
  a significant level of cross-linguistic non-arbitrariness. In sum, the paper provides
  new methods to detect cross-linguistic associations at scale.
