abstract: The study of linguistic typology is rooted in the implications we find between
  linguistic features, such as the fact that languages with object-verb word ordering
  tend to have postpositions. Uncovering such implications typically amounts to time-consuming
  manual processing by trained and experienced linguists, which potentially leaves
  key linguistic universals unexplored. In this paper, we present a computational
  model which successfully identifies known universals, including Greenberg universals,
  but also uncovers new ones, worthy of further linguistic investigation. Our approach
  outperforms baselines previously used for this problem, as well as a strong baseline
  from knowledge base population.
