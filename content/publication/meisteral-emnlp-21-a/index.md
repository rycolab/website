abstract: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis posits a preference among
  language users for utterances structured such that information is distributed uniformly
  across a signal. While its implications on language production have been well explored,
  the hypothesis potentially makes predictions about language comprehension and linguistic
  acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how uniformity in a linguistic signal
  -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and over which linguistic unit, e.g.,
  the sentence or language level, this uniformity should hold. Here we investigate
  these facets of the UID hypothesis using reading time and acceptability data. While
  our reading time results are generally consistent with previous work, they are also
  consistent with a weakly super-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible
  with UID's predictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that
  non-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We then
  explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different interpretations
  of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which the pressure towards
  uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset of the proposed operationalizations
  suggests that the strongest trend may be a regression towards a mean surprisal across
  the language, rather than the phrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports
  a typical interpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users
  maximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.
