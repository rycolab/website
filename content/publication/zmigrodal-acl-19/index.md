abstract: Gender stereotypes are manifest in most of the world's languages and are
  consequently propagated or amplified by NLP systems. Although research has focused
  on mitigating gender stereotypes in English, the approaches that are commonly employed
  produce ungrammatical sentences in morphologically rich languages. We present a
  novel approach for converting between masculine-inflected and feminine-inflected
  sentences in such languages. For Spanish and Hebrew, our approach achieves F1 scores
  of 82% and 73% at the level of tags and accuracies of 90% and 87% at the level of
  forms. By evaluating our approach using four different languages, we show that,
  on average, it reduces gender stereotyping by a factor of 2.5 without any sacrifice
  to grammaticality.
