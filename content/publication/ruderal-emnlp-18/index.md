abstract: We introduce a novel discriminative latent-variable model for the task of
  bilingual lexicon induction. Our model combines the bipartite matching dictionary
  prior of Haghighi et al. (2008) with a state-of-the-art embedding-based approach.
  To train the model, we derive an efficient Viterbi EM algorithm. We provide empirical
  improvements on six language pairs under two metrics and show that the prior theoretically
  and empirically helps to mitigate the hubness problem. We also demonstrate how previous
  work may be viewed as a similarly fashioned latent-variable model, albeit with a
  different prior.
