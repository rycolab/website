abstract: The popular skip-gram model induces word embeddings by exploiting the signal
  from word-context coocurrence. We offer a new interpretation of skip-gram based
  on exponential family PCA-a form of matrix factorization to generalize the skip-gram
  model to tensor factorization. In turn, this lets us train embeddings through richer
  higher-order coocurrences, e.g., triples that include positional information (to
  incorporate syntax) or morphological information (to share parameters across related
  words). We experiment on 40 languages and show our model improves upon skip-gram.
