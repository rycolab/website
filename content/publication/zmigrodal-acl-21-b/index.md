abstract: Weighted finite-state machines are a fundamental building block of NLP systems.
  They have withstood the test of time—from their early use in noisy channel models
  in the 1990s up to modern-day neurally parameterized conditional random fields.
  This work examines the computation of higher-order derivatives with respect to the
  normalization constant for weighted finite-state machines. We provide a general
  algorithm for evaluating derivatives of all orders, which has not been previously
  described in the literature. In the case of second-order derivatives, our scheme
  runs in the optimal O(Aˆ2 Nˆ4) time where A is the alphabet size and N is the number
  of states. Our algorithm is significantly faster than prior algorithms. Additionally,
  our approach leads to a significantly faster algorithm for computing second-order
  expectations, such as covariance matrices and gradients of first-order expectations.
