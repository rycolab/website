abstract: 'In the principles-and-parameters framework, the structural features of
  languages depend on parameters that may be toggled on or off, with a single parameter
  often dictating the status of multiple features. The implied covariance between
  features inspires our probabilisation of this line of linguistic inquiry---we develop
  a generative model of language based on exponential-family matrix factorisation.
  By modelling all languages and features within the same architecture, we show how
  structural similarities between languages can be exploited to predict typological
  features with near-perfect accuracy, outperforming several baselines on the task
  of predicting held-out features. Furthermore, we show that language embeddings pre-trained
  on monolingual text allow for generalisation to unobserved languages. This finding
  has clear practical and also theoretical implications: the results confirm what
  linguists have hypothesised, i.e. that there are significant correlations between
  typological features and languages.'
