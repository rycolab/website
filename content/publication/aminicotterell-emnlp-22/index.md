abstract: 'There have been many proposals to reduce constituency parsing to tagging
  in the literature. To better understand what these approaches have in common, we
  cast several existing proposals into a unifying pipeline consisting of three steps:
  linearization, learning, and decoding. In particular, we show how to reduce tetratagging,
  a state-of-the-art constituency tagger, to shift--reduce parsing by performing a
  right-corner transformation on the grammar and making a specific independence assumption.
  Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our taxonomy of tagging pipelines with different
  choices of linearizers, learners, and decoders. Based on the results in English
  and a set of 8 typologically diverse languages, we conclude that the linearization
  of the derivation tree and its alignment with the input sequence is the most critical
  factor in achieving accurate taggers.'
