abstract: 'We introduce a generalization of classic information-theoretic measures
  of predictive uncertainty in online language processing, based on the simulation
  of expected continuations of incremental linguistic contexts. Our framework provides
  a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters
  with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol
  entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language
  models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate
  alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special
  cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal
  for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes,
  and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.'
