abstract: 'The SIGMORPHON 2022 shared task on morpheme segmentation challenged systems
  to decompose a word into a sequence of morphemes and covered most types of morphology:
  compounds, derivations, and inflections. Subtask 1, word-level morpheme segmentation,
  covered 5 million words in 9 languages (Czech, English, Spanish, Hungarian, French,
  Italian, Russian, Latin, Mongolian) and received 13 system submissions from 7 teams
  and the best system averaged 97.29% F1 score across all languages, ranging English
  (93.84%) to Latin (99.38%). Subtask 2, sentence-level morpheme segmentation, covered
  18,735 sentences in 3 languages (Czech, English, Mongolian), received 10 system
  submissions from 3 teams, and the best systems outperformed all three state-of-the-art
  subword tokenization methods (BPE, ULM, Morfessor2) by 30.71% absolute. To facilitate
  error analysis and support any type of future studies, we released all system predictions,
  the evaluation script, and all gold standard datasets.'
