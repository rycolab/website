abstract: While idiosyncrasies of the Chinese classifier system have been a richly
  studied topic among linguists (Adams and Conklin, 1973; Erbaugh, 1986; Lakoff, 1986),
  not much work has been done to quantify them with statistical methods. In this paper,
  we introduce an information-theoretic approach to measuring idiosyncrasy; we examine
  how much the uncertainty in Mandarin Chinese classifiers can be reduced by knowing
  semantic information about the nouns that the classifiers modify. Using the empirical
  distribution of classifiers from the parsed Chinese Gigaword corpus (Graff et al.,
  2005), we compute the mutual information (in bits) between the distribution over
  classifiers and distributions over other linguistic quantities. We investigate whether
  semantic classes of nouns and adjectives differ in how much they reduce uncertainty
  in classifier choice, and find that it is not fully idiosyncratic; while there are
  no obvious trends for the majority of semantic classes, shape nouns reduce uncertainty
  in classifier choice the most.
