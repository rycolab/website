abstract: Most modern NLP systems make use of pre-trained contextual representations
  that attain astonishingly high performance on a variety of tasks. Such high performance
  should not be possible unless some form of linguistic structure inheres in these
  representations, and a wealth of research has sprung up on probing for it. In this
  paper, we draw a distinction between intrinsic probing, which examines how linguistic
  information is structured within a representation, and the extrinsic probing popular
  in prior work, which only argues for the presence of such information by showing
  that it can be successfully extracted. To enable intrinsic probing, we propose a
  novel framework based on a decomposable multivariate Gaussian probe that allows
  us to determine whether the linguistic information in word embeddings is dispersed
  or focal. We then probe fastText and BERT for various morphosyntactic attributes
  across 36 languages. We find that most attributes are reliably encoded by only a
  few neurons, with fastText concentrating its linguistic structure more than BERT.
