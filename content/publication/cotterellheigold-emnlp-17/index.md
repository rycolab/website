abstract: Even for common NLP tasks, sufficient supervision is not available in many
  languages--morphological tagging is no exception. In the work presented here, we
  explore a transfer learning scheme, whereby we train character-level recurrent neural
  taggers to predict morphological taggings for high-resource languages and low-resource
  languages together. Learning joint character representations among multiple related
  languages successfully enables knowledge transfer from the high-resource languages
  to the low-resource ones.
