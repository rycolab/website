abstract: The CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2018 shared task on supervised learning of morphological
  generation featured data sets from 103 typologically diverse languages. Apart from
  extending the number of languages involved in earlier supervised tasks of generating
  inflected forms, this year the shared task also featured a new second task which
  asked participants to inflect words in sentential context, similar to a cloze task.
  This second task featured seven languages. Task 1 received 27 submissions and task
  2 received 6 submissions. Both tasks featured a low, medium, and high data condition.
  Nearly all submissions featured a neural component and built on highly-ranked systems
  from the earlier 2017 shared task. In the inflection task (task 1), 41 of the 52
  languages present in last year’s inflection task showed improvement by the best
  systems in the low-resource setting. The cloze task (task 2) proved to be difficult,
  and few submissions managed to consistently improve upon both a simple neural baseline
  system and a lemmarepeating baseline.
