abstract: Several recent papers claim to have achieved human parity at sentence-level
  machine translation (MT)â€”especially between high-resource language pairs. In response,
  the MT community has, in part, shifted its focus to document-level translation.
  Translating documents requires a deeper understanding of the structure and meaning
  of text, which is often captured by various kinds of discourse phenomena such as
  consistency, coherence, and cohesion. However, this renders conventional sentence-level
  MT evaluation benchmarks inadequate for evaluating the performance of context-aware
  MT systems. This paperpresents a new dataset with rich discourse annotations, built
  upon the large-scale parallel corpus BWB introduced in Jiang et al. (2022a). The
  new BWB annotation introduces four extra evaluation aspects, i.e., entity, terminology,
  coreference, and quotation, covering 15,095 entity mentions in both languages. Using
  these annotations, we systematically investigate the similarities and differences
  between the discourse structures of source and target languages, and the challenges
  they pose to MT. We discover that MT outputs differ fundamentally from human translations
  in terms of their latent discourse structures. This gives us a new perspective on
  the challenges and opportunities in document-level MT. We make our resource publicly
  available to spur future research in document-level MT and its generalization to
  other language translation tasks.
