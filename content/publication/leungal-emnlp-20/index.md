abstract: Across languages, multiple consecutive adjectives modifying a noun (e.g.
  ``the big red dog″) follow certain unmarked ordering rules. While explanatory accounts
  have been put forward, much of the work done in this area has relied primarily on
  the intuitive judgment of native speakers, rather than on corpus data. We present
  the first purely corpus-driven model of multi-lingual adjective ordering in the
  form of a latent-variable model that can accurately order adjectives across 24 different
  languages, even when the training and testing languages are different. We utilize
  this novel statistical model to provide strong converging evidence for the existence
  of universal, cross-linguistic, hierarchical adjective ordering tendencies.
