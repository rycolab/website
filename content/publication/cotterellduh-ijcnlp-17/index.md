abstract: Low-resource named entity recognition is still an open problem in NLP. Most
  state-of-the-art systems require tens of thousands of annotated sentences in order
  to obtain high performance. However, for most of the world's languages it is unfeasible
  to obtain such annotation. In this paper, we present a transfer learning scheme,
  whereby we train character-level neural CRFs to predict named entities for both
  high-resource languages and low-resource languages jointly. Learning character representations
  for multiple related languages allows knowledge transfer from the high-resource
  languages to the low-resource ones, improving F1 by up to 9.8 points.
