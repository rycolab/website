abstract: The Bar-Hillel construction is a classic result in formal language theory.
  It shows, by construction, that the intersection between a context-free language
  and a regular language is itself context-free. However, neither its original formulation
  (Bar-Hillel et al., 1961) nor its weighted extension (Nederhof and Satta, 2003)
  can handle automata with ϵ-arcs. In this short note, we generalize the Bar-Hillel
  construction to correctly compute the intersection even when the automaton contains
  ϵ-arcs. We further prove that our generalized construction leads to a grammar that
  encodes the structure of both the input automaton and grammar while retaining the
  asymptotic size of the original construction.
