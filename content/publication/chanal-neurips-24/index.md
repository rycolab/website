abstract: 'Pre-trained language encoders---functions that represent text as vectors---are
  an integral component of many NLP tasks. We tackle a natural question in language
  encoder analysis: What does it mean for two encoders to be similar? We contend that
  a faithful measure of similarity needs to be emphintrinsic, that is, task-independent,
  yet still be informative of emphextrinsic similarity---the performance on downstream
  tasks. It is common to consider two encoders similar if they are emphhomotopic,
  i.e., if they can be aligned through some transformation. In this spirit, we study
  the properties of emphaffine alignment of language encoders and its implications
  on extrinsic similarity. We find that while affine alignment is fundamentally an
  asymmetric notion of similarity, it is still informative of extrinsic similarity.
  We confirm this on datasets of natural language representations. Beyond providing
  useful bounds on extrinsic similarity, affine intrinsic similarity also allows us
  to begin uncovering the structure of the space of pre-trained encoders by defining
  an order over them.'
