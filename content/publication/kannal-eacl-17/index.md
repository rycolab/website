abstract: We explore the task of multi-source morphological reinflection, which generalizes
  the standard, single-source version. The input consists of (i) a target tag and
  (ii) multiple pairs of source form and source tag for a lemma. The motivation is
  that it is beneficial to have access to more than one source form since different
  source forms can provide complementary information, e.g., different stems. We further
  present a novel extension to the encoder-decoder recurrent neural architecture,
  consisting of multiple encoders, to better solve the task. We show that our new
  architecture outperforms single-source reinflection models and publish our dataset
  for multi-source morphological reinflection to facilitate future research.
