abstract: A grammatical gender system divides a lexicon into a small number of relatively
  fixed grammatical categories. How similar are these gender systems across languages?
  To quantify the similarity, we define gender systems extensionally, thereby reducing
  the problem of comparisons between languages’ gender systems to cluster evaluation.
  We borrow a rich inventory of statistical tools for cluster evaluation from the
  field of community detection (Driver and Kroeber, 1932; Cattell, 1945), that enable
  us to craft novel information-theoretic metrics for measuring similarity between
  gender systems. We first validate our metrics, then use them to measure gender system
  similarity in 20 languages. Finally, we ask whether our gender system similarities
  alone are sufficient to reconstruct historical relationships between languages.
  Towards this end, we make phylogenetic predictions on the popular, but thorny, problem
  from historical linguistics of inducing a phylogenetic tree over extant Indo-European
  languages. Languages on the same branch of our phylogenetic tree are notably similar,
  whereas languages from separate branches are no more similar than chance.
