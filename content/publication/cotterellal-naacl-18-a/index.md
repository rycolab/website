abstract: 'For general modeling methods applied to diverse languages, a natural question
  is: how well should we expect our models to work on languages with differing typological
  profiles? In this work, we develop an evaluation framework for fair cross-linguistic
  comparison of language models, using translated text so that all models are asked
  to predict approximately the same information. We then conduct a study on 21 languages,
  demonstrating that in some languages, the textual expression of the information
  is harder to predict with both n-gram and LSTM language models. We show complex
  inflectional morphology to be a cause of performance differences among languages.'
