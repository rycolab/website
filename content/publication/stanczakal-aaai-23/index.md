abstract: The success of pre-trained contextualized representations has prompted researchers
  to analyze them for the presence of linguistic information. Indeed, it is natural
  to assume that these pre-trained representations do encode some level of linguistic
  knowledge as they have brought about large empirical improvements on a wide variety
  of NLP tasks, which suggests they are learning true linguistic generalization. In
  this work, we focus on intrinsic probing, an analysis technique where the goal is
  not only to identify whether a representation encodes a linguistic attribute but
  also to pinpoint where this attribute is encoded. We propose a novel latent-variable
  formulation for constructing intrinsic probes and derive a tractable variational
  approximation to the log-likelihood. Our results show that our model is versatile
  and yields tighter mutual information estimates than two intrinsic probes previously
  proposed in the literature. Finally, we find empirical evidence that pre-trained
  representations develop a cross-lingually entangled notion of morphosyntax.
