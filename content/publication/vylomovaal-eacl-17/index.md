abstract: Derivational morphology is a fundamental and complex characteristic of language.
  In this paper we propose a new task of predicting the derivational form of a given
  base-form lemma that is appropriate for a given context. We present an encoder-decoder
  style neural network to produce a derived form character-by-character, based on
  its corresponding character-level representation of the base form and the context.
  We demonstrate that our model is able to generate valid context-sensitive derivations
  from known base forms, but is less accurate under lexicon agnostic setting.
