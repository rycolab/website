abstract: In common law, the outcome of a new case is determined mostly by precedent
  cases, rather than by existing statutes. However, how exactly does the precedent
  influence the outcome of a new case? Answering this question is crucial for guaranteeing
  fair and consistent judicial decision-making. We are the first to approach this
  question computationally by comparing two longstanding jurisprudential views; Halsbury's,
  who believes that the arguments of the precedent are the main determinant of the
  outcome, and Goodhart's, who believes that what matters most is the precedent's
  facts. We base our study on the corpus of legal cases from the European Court of
  Human Rights (ECtHR), which allows us to access not only the case itself, but also
  cases cited in the judges' arguments (i.e. the precedent cases).  Taking an information-theoretic
  view, and modelling the question as a case outcome classification task, we find
  that the precedent's arguments share 0.38 nats of information with the case's outcome,
  whereas precedent's facts only share 0.18 nats of information (i.e., 58% less);
  suggesting Halsbury's view may be more accurate in this specific court.  We found
  however in a qualitative analysis that there are specific statues where Goodhart's
  view dominates, and present some evidence these are the ones where the legal concept
  at hand is less straightforward.
