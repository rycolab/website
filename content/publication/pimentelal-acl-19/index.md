abstract: 'A longstanding debate in semiotics centers on the relationship between
  linguistic signs and their corresponding semantics: is there an arbitrary relationship
  between a word form and its meaning, or does some systematic phenomenon pervade?
  For instance, does the character bigram `gl′ have any systematic relationship to
  the meaning of words like `glisten′, `gleam′ and `glow′? In this work, we offer
  a holistic quantification of the systematicity of the sign using mutual information
  and recurrent neural networks. We employ these in a data-driven and massively multilingual
  approach to the question, examining 106 languages. We find a statistically significant
  reduction in entropy when modeling a word form conditioned on its semantic representation.
  Encouragingly, we also recover well-attested English examples of systematic affixes.
  We conclude with the meta-point: Our approximate effect size (measured in bits)
  is quite small---despite some amount of systematicity between form and meaning,
  an arbitrary relationship and its resulting benefits dominate human language.'
