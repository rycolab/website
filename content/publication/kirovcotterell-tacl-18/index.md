abstract: Can advances in NLP help advance cognitive modeling? We examine the role
  of artificial neural networks, the current state of the art in many common NLP tasks,
  by returning to a classic case study. In 1986, Rumelhart and McClelland famously
  introduced a neural architecture that learned to transduce English verb stems to
  their past tense forms. Shortly thereafter in 1988, Pinker and Prince presented
  a comprehensive rebuttal of many of Rumelhart and McClelland's claims. Much of the
  force of their attack centered on the empirical inadequacy of the Rumelhart and
  McClelland model. Today, however, that model is severely outmoded. We show that
  the Encoder-Decoder network architectures used in modern NLP systems obviate most
  of Pinker and Prince's criticisms without requiring any simplification of the past
  tense mapping problem. We suggest that the empirical performance of modern networks
  warrants a reexamination of their utility in linguistic and cognitive modeling.
