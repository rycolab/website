## Course Description
Since Shannon originally proposed his mathematical theory of communication in the middle of the 20th century, information theory has been an important way of viewing and investigating problems at the interfaces between linguistics, cognitive science, and computation, respectively. With the upsurgence in applying machine learning approaches to linguistics questions, information-theoretic methods are becoming an ever more important tool in the linguistâ€™s toolbox. This cutting-edge tutorial, which draws on the work of many different researchers, emphasizes interdisciplinary connections between the fields of linguistics and natural language processing. We plan to do this by reviewing the mathematical basis of information theory. We then show it can be fruitfully applied to several linguistic applications, ranging from semantics, typology, morphology, phonotactics, and to the interface between cognitive science and linguistics. We then discuss recent research---spanning fields from psycholinguistics to machine learning---that have made progress in the analysis of natural language using these techniques. Throughout the tutorial, we will provide hands-on exercises that allow you to put theory into practice in linguistic applications.
