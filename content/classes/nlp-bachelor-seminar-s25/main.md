## Course Description
In recent years, NLP has become a part of our daily lives. Many of us use chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude to translate a text from a foreign language, help draft essays, write code, and even answer everyday-life questions. However, even though most people recognize the utility of such tools, there are still many questions to be answered about their reliability and their impact on society. In this bachelor seminar, we take a closer look at NLP by discussing some of the most influential NLP papers and opinion articles, with a special focus on controversial topics regarding the role of NLP in society. Each week, students will present one of the papers from the schedule below, followed by a class discussion.

**Time:** Wednesday 12-14h

**Location:** CAB G 52
