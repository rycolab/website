title = 'Neural Networks and Computational Complexity, Fall 2024'

summary = 'This Bachelorâ€™s seminar delves into the fascinating world of modern large language models (LLMs), which have revolutionized natural language processing. As these models continue to evolve and impact various domains, we will explore their potential, limitations, and underlying mechanisms through critical discussion and analysis.Throughout the seminar, we will address the following key questions:What are the real capabilities of large language models? What are their inherent limitations? How do these models function at a fundamental level? Under what circumstances are they likely to fail? Can we develop a comprehensive "science of LLMs" to address these inquiries? We will leverage formal language theory to provide a rigorous framework for understanding the representational capacity of neural language models.'
