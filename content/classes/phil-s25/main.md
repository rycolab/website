## Course Description

This graduate class, partly taught like a seminar, is designed to help you understand the philosophical underpinnings of modern work in natural language processing (NLP), most of which is centered around statistical machine learning applied to natural language data. The course will alternate between presentations given by the professors and by students enrolled in the course, followed by discussion-based teaching on the topics of each class. It is a two-semester-long journey, but the second half (Spring 2025) does not depend on the first (Spring 2024) and thus either half may be taken independently. In each semester, we divide the class time into three modules. Each module focuses on a philosophical topic. After discussing logicist, structuralist, and generative approaches to language in PLC I, in this semester we will focus on use theory of meaning, information theory, and critical perspectives on meaning. The modules will be between 3 and 5 weeks long. Half of each module will be devoted to reading and discussing theoretical texts and supplementary criticism. In the other half, we will read recent NLP papers and discuss how they relate to philosophical insights into our conception of language—perhaps implicitly or unwittingly. The course is designed to foster fruitful exchanges between students from different disciplinary horizons, especially between the STEM and the humanities. As such, no prior knowledge of CS/AI/NLP or philosophy is assumed.

The course will require a weekly reading of around 20 pages (with relatively high variance) and a weekly task (free-form response) related to the reading, which is to be completed online. The weekly tasks are short and not graded, but, in order to pass the class, at least 70% of the tasks must be completed. See [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nzse9BFdJJDCcYaIq--5r5rbw-Xi8Or1/view?usp=share_link) for the guidelines on the free-form responses. The final grade will be based on one class presentation and one term paper (around 5-10 pages) which is to be turned in at the end of the semester. The term paper ideally corresponds to one of the three modules and the students will be expected to explore the relation of the topics discussed in class to work **not** presented in the class. For example, challenging how three recent NLP papers interpreted Wittgenstein's use theory of meaning would be a good topic.

#### Grading

Marks for the course will be determined by the following formula:

- **40%** Class presentation
- **60%** Term paper
