abstract: "Children start to communicate and use language in social interactions from a very young age. This allows them to experiment with their developing linguistic knowledge and receive valuable feedback from their interlocutors. While research in language acquisition has focused a great deal on children's ability to learn from the linguistic input or social cues, little work, in comparison, has investigated the nature and role of Communicative Feedback, a process that results from children and caregivers trying to coordinate mutual understanding. In this presentation, I will draw on insights from theories of communicative coordination to formalize a mechanism for language acquisition: We argue that children can improve their linguistic knowledge in conversation by leveraging explicit or implicit signals of communication success or failure. This new formalization provides a common framework for several lines of research in child development and will enable us to obtain a more complete understanding of language acquisition within and through social interaction. Finally, I will present a recent corpus study that highlights the role of Communicative Feedback as a mechanism supporting the production of intelligible speech in early childhood as well as preliminary results regarding the role of such feedback mechanisms for learning the grammar of one's native language."
