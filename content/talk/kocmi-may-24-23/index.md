summary:
abstract: "For years, the progress in modeling has outpaced the evaluation in NLP, where we relied predominantly on string-based matching metrics. In this talk, we will outline the benefits and differences among the three classes of metrics: n-gram matching (such as ChrF or BLEU), pretrained models (COMET, BLEURT), and black-box LLMs (GEMBA). We will primarily focus on the emerging evaluation based on LLMs, highlighting open questions and challenges anticipated in the upcoming era."
