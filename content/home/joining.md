Thank you for your interest in joining our group! I (Ryan) get a lot of e-mail about joining our lab. Almost all the applicants are super interesting, well-qualified people who I would be very happy to supervise during their journey towards a PhD. However, for the time being, the lab is not accepting new PhD students. Over the last year or so, there has been unbridled exuberance in joining my group and we grew quite quickly. For the foreseeable future, I am not accepting new PhD students except under exceptional circumstances where I already have a previous working relationship with the individual. If you are interested in working with me as a Master’s student, please see [here](https://rycolab.github.io/#projects); I also co-advise Master’s students on NLP topics with [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/). 

I spend a lot of time with those I collaborate with. I am a hands-on advisor who writes large swathes—often the majority—of our papers and has a strong opinion on modeling aesthetics, code style and experimental design. (That may not be what you are looking for during your PhD, which is perfectly fine.) This style of advising takes up a lot of my time, which is already stretched quite thin as it is. In many ways, I am more of a collaborator than a traditional advisor: 

One caveat to the above: If you are interested in NLP at ETHZ and do not yet have a Master’s degree, please consider applying to ETHZ’s [direct doctorate program](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html). You should tag [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/) and me and that you are interested in NLP.
