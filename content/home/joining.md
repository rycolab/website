Thank you very much for your interest in joining our group! We do get a lot of emails about joining our lab from super interesting, well-qualified applicants who we would be very happy to have as research colleagues. 

There has been unbridled exuberance over joining our group and we grew quite quickly. Thus, for the foreseeable future, we can only accept new PhD students under one of the following special circumstances:

- If you are interested in NLP at ETHZ and do not yet have a Master’s degree, please consider applying to ETHZ’s [direct doctorate program](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html). You should tag [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/) and me and that you are interested in NLP. 

- Consider that ETHZ is part of the ELLIS PhD program, which supports PhDs and postdoctoral fellows by providing access to leading researchers through boot camps, summer schools and workshops of the ELLIS programs. You can apply for admission through the [centralized application portal](https://ellis.eu/en/news/ellis-phd-program-call-for-applications); the deadline is the 1st of December 2020. Our lab works closely with [CopeNLU](https://copenlu.github.io/) headed by [Isabelle Augenstein](http://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/) at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/); applicants who apply through ELLIS are encouraged to tag both Ryan and Isabelle as they are both part of the ELLIS network


- Ryan is also core faculty member of the newly-established [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch) which offers [fully-funded PhD and Post-doctoral fellowships](https://ai.ethz.ch/education/phd-and-postdoc-programs.html). Please [apply here](https://ethaicenter.recruitee.com/o/eth-ai-center-doctoral-fellowship/c/new) and describe how you intend to take an interdisciplinary perspective on NLP.

- You have a previous working relationship with members of our group or there is a co-advisor who has a previous working relationship with our lab. 

If you are interested in working with me as a Master’s student, please see [here](https://rycolab.github.io/#projects). I (Ryan) have previously co-advised Master’s students on NLP topics with [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/), if co-advising is an option you would like to pursue. At Cambridge, I co-advise MPhil students with [Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/). 

Note on our research focus and collaboration style: we don’t do leaderboard science or chase state-of-the-art numbers on ephemeral datasets. If you’re okay with that, awesome! You’ll probably fit right in. I spend a lot of time with those I collaborate with. I am a hands-on advisor who writes large swathes of our papers. I am also known to have a strong opinion on modeling aesthetics, code style and experimental design. That may not be what you are looking for during your PhD, which is perfectly fine. This style of advising takes up a lot of my time, which is already stretched quite thin as it is, and, hence, the need to limit admissions. In many ways, I am more of a collaborator than a traditional advisor.
