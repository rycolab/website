Thank you for your interest in joining our group! Full disclosure: We don’t do leaderboard science or chase state-of-the-art numbers on ephemeral datasets. If you’re okay with that, awesome! You’ll probably fit right in.

We do get a lot of email about joining our lab from super interesting, well-qualified applicants who we would be very happy to have as research colleagues. However, over the past year or so, there has been unbridled exuberance over joining our group and we grew quite quickly. Thus, for the foreseeable future, we are not accepting new PhD students except under exceptional circumstances where the student has a previous working relationship with members of our group. One caveat to the above: If you are interested in NLP at ETHZ and do not yet have a Master’s degree, please consider applying to ETHZ’s [direct doctorate program](https://inf.ethz.ch/doctorate/direct-doctorate-computer-science.html). You should tag [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/) and me and that you are interested in NLP. Admission to the direct doctorate program requires you to name two supervisors at ETHZ. 

If you are interested in working with me as a Master’s student and are already at ETHZ, please see [here](https://rycolab.github.io/#projects). I (Ryan) have previously co-advised Master’s students on NLP topics with [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://sites.google.com/site/mrinsachan/), if co-advising is an option you would like to pursue. At Cambridge, I co-advise MPhil students with [Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/). 

Note: I spend a lot of time with those I collaborate with. I am a hands-on advisor who writes large swathes of our papers. I am also known to have a strong opinion on modeling aesthetics, code style and experimental design. That may not be what you are looking for during your PhD, which is perfectly fine. This style of advising takes up a lot of my time, which is already stretched quite thin as it is, and, hence, the need to limit admissions. In many ways, I am more of a collaborator than a traditional advisor.
