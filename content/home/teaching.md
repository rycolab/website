## [Natural Language Processing](classes/intro-nlp-f25)
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Fall 2025**
This course presents topics in natural language processing with an emphasis on modern techniques, primarily focusing on statistical and deep learning approaches. The course provides an overview of the primary areas of research in language processing as well as a detailed exploration of the models and techniques used both in research and in commercial natural language systems.

## [Advanced Formal Language Theory](/classes/aflt-s25) 
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2025**
This course explores the connection between automata and formal logic. More precisely, it covers the algebraic characterization of the regular languages definable in many different logical theories, the complexity theory of boolean circuits, and the connection between the two.

## [Philosophy of Language and Computation II](/classes/phil-s25) 
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2025**
This graduate class, partly taught like a seminar, is designed to help you understand the philosophical underpinnings of modern work in natural language processing (NLP), most of which is centered around statistical machine learning applied to natural language data.

## [Understanding Context-Free Parsing Algorithms](classes/nlp-bachelor-seminar-s25)
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2025**
In the first part of the seminar, we study some of the most popular parsing algorithms, which are a fundamental tool both in natural language processing and in programming languages. Each week, a student will present a paper on parsing, including the papers that first described celebrated parsing algorithms like Earley's and CKY. We will also put a lot of focus on *weighted* parsing, which is fundamental in applications to language modeling. In the second part, we'll examine advanced NLP topics through analysis of pivotal (and often controversial) papers that are shaping the field's future direction.
