## [Advanced Formal Language Theory](/classes/aflt-s23) 
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2023**
This course serves as an introduction to various advanced topics in formal language theory. The primary focus of the course is on weighted formalisms, which can easily be applied in machine learning. Topics include finite-state machines as well as the algorithms that are commonly used for their manipulation. We will also cover weighted context-free grammars, weighted tree automata, and weighted mildly context-sensitive formalisms.

## [Large Language Models](/classes/llm-s23) 
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2023**
Large language models have become one of the most commonly deployed NLP inventions. In the past half-decade, their integration into core natural language processing tools has dramatically increased the performance of such tools, and they have entered the public discourse surrounding artificial intelligence. In this course, we start with the probabilistic foundations of language models, i.e., covering what constitutes a language model from a formal, theoretical perspective. We then discuss how to construct and curate training corpora, and introduce many of the neural-network architectures often used to instantiate language models at scale. The course covers aspects of systems programming, discussion of privacy and harms, as well as applications of language models in NLP and beyond.

## [Philosophy of Language and Computation II](/classes/phil-s23) 
**ETH Z端rich** <span class="middot-divider"></span> **Spring 2023**
This graduate class, taught like a seminar, is designed to help you understand the philosophical underpinnings of modern work in natural language processing (NLP), most of which centered around statistical machine learning applied to natural language data.
