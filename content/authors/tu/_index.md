Hi, my name is Tu. I received a BSc degree of Math and Computer Science at Ecole Polytechnique, France and currently a second year Data science master student at ETH. My interests in NLP are interpretability of LLM and formal languages. When I’m free from work, I enjoy cooking and playing competitive sports (football, badminton, table tennis, chess, ...).
