Edoardo is a prospective postdoctoral fellow at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal, Canada. He is expected to complete his Ph.D. at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in September 2020.  In Cambridge, he was affiliated with [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/) and supervised by Prof. [Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/) and [Ivan VuliÄ‡](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/). As an undergrad, he studied modern literature at the [University of Pavia](http://wcm-3.unipv.it/site/en/home.html), Italy. He works closely with Ryan. He previously interned as an AI/ML researcher at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) in Cupertino. His research has been supported by a [Google Research Faculty Award](https://ai.google/research/outreach/faculty-research-awards/) and an [ERC PoC](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/news/prof-anna-korhonens-project-enabling-multilingual-conversational-ai-awarded-erc-proof-concept) grant for projects co-written with his supervisors.
