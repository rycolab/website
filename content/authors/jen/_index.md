Jennifer is a first-year PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by Ryan. She earned an MMathPhys in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Warwick and an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge where she was also supervised by Ryan. She is interested in techniques for low-resource NLP, gender bias in NLP and annotation of linguistic data, among other things. Her background is in Algebraic Geometry, so she is always happy to get a chance to put her mathematical skills to good use. In her spare time she enjoys learning languages, reading, eating chicken katsu curry and travelling as much as possible.

Native Language: English
