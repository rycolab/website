Second-year Master’s student of Data Science with an interest in the applications and security of language models. Originally from Iceland, where the only thing colder than the weather is the people, you’ll find me running, on the golf course, or in the mountains hiking, alpine or cross-country skiing when I’m not studying in food&lab.
