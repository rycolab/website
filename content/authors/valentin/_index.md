Second-year master's student (CS) and machine learning enthusiast with some background in probabilistic modeling. With interests torn between Computer Vision and NLP, I'll probably soon get a badge for having booked every ML course at ETH. Born and raised in Zurich, I like to pretend to be an expert in Swiss culture and cheese.
