Hi, my name is Matej! I am a second-year Master's student in CS interested in LLMs, computer vision, and graphics. Born and raised in the beautiful city of Prague, Czech Republic, I always like to be busy playing or making computer or board games, finishing the occasional bouldering session or a hike, or playing the piano. That is when I don't have to be grinding for yet another deadline at ETH.
