Eleftheria is a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. She is advised by Ryan and [Elliott Ash](https://elliottash.com/). Previously, she was a Research Engineer at Disney Research where she worked on natural language understanding and emotion classification. Eleftheria received an MSc in Artificial Intelligence with specialization in NLP from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) where her thesis was on machine translation. Before that, she received a BA in English Language and Literature with specialization in Linguistics from the [University of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_and_Kapodistrian_University_of_Athens). Her research interests include surprisal, discourse structure, and computational narratology (particularly NLP for literary and screenwriting analysis). Outside of research, Eleftheria likes exploring Switzerland by train.
