Vilém Zouhar (Vilda) is a PhD student in [Mrinmaya Sachan's lab](https://www.mrinmaya.io/). In the past he worked primarily on machine translation but is now studying a variety of NLP topics, especially those with ties to compression and optimization theory. After finishing his undergraduate at Charles University, he obtained his master degrees at Groningen University and Saarland University. While waiting for the models to converge, he enjoys board games and amateur singing and playing instruments.
