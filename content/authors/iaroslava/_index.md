Iaroslava is a Master’s student in Computer Science with a background from TU Berlin, and she is now diving into machine learning. Unable to choose between NLP and Computer Vision, she has ended up taking almost every course she could find in both areas. She is particularly interested in the intersection of formal language theory and machine learning. In her free time, you can find her dancing salsa, learning foreign languages, hiking, or skiing.
