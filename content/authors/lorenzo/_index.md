Second-year Master's student in Data Science, interested in mathematically grounded machine learning and both deep learning and statistics. Lorenzo is from Milan, Italy's most beautiful city. In his free time, he enjoys endurance sports; he used to do triathlons, but has now shifted to easy coffee rides.
