Alex Warstadt is a Postdoctoral Fellow at ETH Zürich in the Computer Science department affiliated with Rycolab and Mrinmaya’s Lab. He completed a PhD in linguistics at New York University supervised by Sam Bowman. As a computational linguist, he uses language models to study human language acquisition and to test the learnability of grammatical phenomena. He also does work in theoretical and experimental pragmatics, studying gradient phenomena in presupposition and relevance.
