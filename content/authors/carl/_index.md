I am a post doc in Machine Learning at the AI Centre, ETH Zurich. I completed my PhD in 2022 at the University of Edinburgh as a member of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science, supervised by Profs Tim Hospedales and Iain Murray. My PhD focused on developing a theoretical understanding of how words are represented: as word embeddings learned from huge text corpora (e.g. by word2vec or GloVe); or as entity embeddings learned from the facts of a knowledge graph. During my PhD I spent 6 months on internship at Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge looking into the interestection of representation learning and logical reasoning.
